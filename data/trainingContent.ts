                content: `Audiovisual (AV) signals are the electronic representations of sound (audio) and pictures (video). In the world of professional AV, we deal with various types of signals that need to be transmitted, switched, and displayed reliably. Understanding the basics of these signals is the first step to designing any AV system.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Analog vs. Digital:** Older signals like VGA (video) and RCA (audio) were analog. Modern signals like HDMI are digital, offering higher quality and more features.\n* **Resolution:** This refers to the number of pixels in a video image, determining its clarity. Common resolutions include 1080p (Full HD) and 4K (Ultra HD).\n* **Bandwidth:** This is the amount of data that can be transmitted over a connection in a given amount of time. Higher resolutions and frame rates require more bandwidth. 4K video requires significantly more bandwidth than 1080p.`

                content: `You'll encounter many different connectors in AV. Here are the most common ones today:\n\n* **HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface):** The industry standard for consumer and commercial AV. It carries uncompressed video, audio, and control data in a single cable.\n* **DisplayPort:** Another digital interface, common on computers and professional displays. It's very similar to HDMI in capability.\n* **USB-C:** A versatile connector that is becoming increasingly popular. It can carry video (using DisplayPort Alternate Mode), data, and power over a single cable, making it ideal for "one-cable" docking solutions.\n* **XLR & Phoenix:** Common connectors for professional balanced audio, used for microphones and connections to amplifiers.`,

The decoder takes the network packets and converts them back into an HDMI signal.\n*   **A Network Switch:** A standard 1Gb or 10Gb network switch acts as the "matrix", routing the packets from any encoder to any decoder.\n\n**WyreStorm's NetworkHD** is our powerful and versatile AVoIP product line. The 500 series, for example, offers visually lossless 4K60 4:4:4 video, plus Dante audio, over a standard 1Gb network.`,

They are used when a single display is either not large enough or not the right shape for the application. There are two main types:\n\n* **LCD Video Walls:** Use special thin-bezel LCD panels. They are great for data visualization in boardrooms and control rooms.\n* **Direct-View LED (dvLED):** Use tiles of tiny LEDs. They are seamless (no bezels) and can be incredibly bright, making them perfect for large-scale digital signage and auditoriums."

                title: 'Processing: The Brains of the Wall',
                content: "You can't just plug an HDMI cable into a video wall. You need a processor to split the source image across the multiple displays. There are several ways to do this:\n\n*   **Internal Processing (Loop/Tiling):** Many video wall panels have a 'loop-through' or 'tiling' mode. You connect your source to the first panel, and then 'daisy-chain' the panels together. The displays' internal processors handle the image splitting. This is simple but can be limited in flexibility.\n*   **Video Wall Matrix (e.g., MX-1616-H2XC-VW):** A dedicated matrix switcher with video wall capabilities. It takes multiple sources and can output them to a specific group of displays in a video wall format.\n*   **AVoIP Decoders:** This is the most flexible method. Each display gets its own decoder (like an **NHD-500-E-RX**). The NetworkHD system handles the video wall processing, allowing for dynamic layouts and control. The **NHD-150-RX** is a specialized decoder that can display multiple sources *on a single screen*, which can then be part of a larger video wall.",

The **NHD-120-RX does not have bezel correction**, so it's not ideal for video walls. The 500 and 600 series decoders have this built-in.\n*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** For a simple video wall showing one source, using an **NHD-500-E-RX** per display is a great, cost-effective AVoIP solution as it omits features not needed in a video wall (like USB).\n*   **Flexibility:** For maximum flexibility (multiple windows, drag-and-drop layouts), use the **NHD-150-RX**. It requires a wireless network for control via the free **NHD-Touch-App**.\n*   **High-End Systems:** The **NHD-600-TRX** can be used as a single, powerful input (TX) to a looped video wall, or as decoders (RX) for the highest quality 4K60 4:4:4 video."
