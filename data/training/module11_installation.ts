      title: 'Pre-Installation & Site Survey',
      content:
        "A successful installation begins long before any equipment is unboxed. The pre-installation phase is critical for avoiding costly mistakes and delays.\n\n**Key Steps**:\n1.  **Site Survey**: Visit the site to verify all measurements. Ensure the physical space matches the plans. Check for any obstructions that might affect display placement or projector throw distance.\n2.  **Verify Services**: Confirm the location and availability of required services. Are there power outlets where you need them? Are the network ports live and in the correct location? Coordinate with electricians and IT departments early.\n3.  **Inspect Equipment**: Unpack and inspect all equipment for shipping damage as soon as it arrives on site, not when you're about to install it. It's much easier to handle a return before the item is mounted to a wall.\n4.  **Coordinate with Other Trades**: Talk to the electricians, builders, and furniture installers. Ensure everyone understands where your equipment and cabling will go to avoid conflicts.",

      title: 'Rack Building & Thermal Management',
      content:
        "The equipment rack is the heart of the system. A well-organized, properly ventilated rack is reliable and easy to service.\n\n**Best Practices**:\n- **Layout**: Place the heaviest items, like amplifiers and UPS units, at the bottom of the rack for stability.\n- **Signal Flow**: Arrange equipment logically. A common approach is sources at the top, control and processing in the middle, and amplifiers at the bottom.\n- **Cable Management**: Use horizontal and vertical managers to keep cables neat. Crucially, **separate power cables from signal cables** (AV, control, network) as much as possible to prevent electromagnetic interference (EMI).\n- **Thermal Management**: Heat is the #1 enemy of electronics. Leave at least **1U (1.75 inches) of space** above heat-producing devices like amplifiers. Use blanking panels to cover empty spaces at the front of the rack, which forces cool air to be drawn through the equipment instead of around it.",

      title: 'Cable Termination & Testing',
      content:
        "Your AV system is only as reliable as its weakest link, and that is often a poorly made cable.\n\n**Termination**:\n- **Use Quality Cable**: For infrastructure cabling (HDBaseT, AVoIP), always use **solid-core copper** category cable, not Copper Clad Aluminum (CCA).\n- **Follow Standards**: The **T568B** wiring standard is the most common for terminating RJ45 connectors in AV installations. Consistency is key.\n- **Use the Right Tools**: Use a quality crimping tool and connectors to ensure a solid, reliable connection.\n\n**Testing**:\n- **Test Every Cable**: Before connecting any equipment, every single infrastructure cable you've installed or terminated must be tested. A simple continuity tester is good, but a **cable certifier** is better as it tests for performance at different frequencies, ensuring your cable can handle high-bandwidth 4K signals.",

      title: 'Mounting Displays & Peripherals',
      content:
        "The physical installation of in-room hardware requires precision and a focus on safety.\n\n- **Displays**: Always use a mount that is rated for the **size and weight** of the display. Use the correct type of hardware for the wall construction (e.g., toggle bolts for drywall, concrete anchors for masonry). Use a spirit level to ensure the mount is perfectly straight.\n- **Projectors**: Carefully calculate the **throw distance** to ensure the image will be the correct size for the screen. Ensure the mount is secure and that all safety tethers are attached.\n- **Speakers**: Position speakers according to the audio plan for optimal coverage. Ensure they are securely mounted and angled correctly.\n- **Cameras & Microphones**: Place cameras to get the desired field of view. Place microphones to achieve the best audio pickup, avoiding sources of noise like HVAC vents.",

      title: 'System Power-Up & Commissioning',
      content:
        "Commissioning is the final step where you bring the system to life and verify its functionality.\n\n**Power-Up Sequence**:\nThere is a correct order to power on an HDMI-based system to ensure a good 'handshake'. Power on devices from the **end of the signal chain to the beginning**:\n1.  Displays / Projectors\n2.  AVR / Audio System\n3.  Matrix Switcher / Extenders\n4.  Source Devices\nThis allows the display to report its capabilities (EDID) to the system before the source starts sending a signal.\n\n**Configuration & Testing**:\n- **Network**: Configure IP addresses for all network-controlled devices.\n- **EDID**: Set EDID management on your switcher if necessary to resolve compatibility issues.\n- **Test All Paths**: Methodically test every input to every output with a known-good source and signal pattern generator.\n- **Test Control**: Verify that every button on your control system (touch panel, keypad) performs the correct action.",
