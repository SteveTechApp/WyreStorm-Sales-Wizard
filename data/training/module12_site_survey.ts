      question: "Why is it important to identify the wall construction type during a site survey?",
      options: ["To choose the right color for the equipment", "To determine the correct type of mounting hardware and fixings", "To decide on the network speed"],
      correctAnswer: "To determine the correct type of mounting hardware and fixings",
      explanation: "You cannot use the same anchors for drywall as you would for concrete. Knowing the wall construction is critical for safely and securely mounting heavy displays or projectors.",

      question: "What is the primary purpose of sketching the room layout?",
      options: ["To practice drawing skills", "To visualize equipment placement and identify potential obstructions", "To create a final architectural drawing"],
      correctAnswer: "To visualize equipment placement and identify potential obstructions",
      explanation: "A sketch helps you confirm sightlines, cable paths, and the physical placement of all AV components in relation to furniture, doors, and windows.",
