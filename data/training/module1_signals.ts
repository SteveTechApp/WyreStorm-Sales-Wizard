      content:
        'At its core, AV is about moving signals from a source to a destination.\n\n- **Analog**: A continuous wave that is susceptible to noise and degradation over distance. Examples include VGA for video and RCA for audio. Analog is considered legacy technology.\n- **Digital**: A signal represented by binary code (1s and 0s). It is much more resistant to noise. If the data arrives, the picture is perfect. Examples include **HDMI, DisplayPort, and SDI**.',

      title: 'Common Connection Types',
      content:
        'Modern AV systems use several types of digital connections. While they may look different, they all carry high-definition video and audio.\n\n- **HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface)**: The most common standard for consumer and pro AV. A single cable carries video, audio, and sometimes control signals.\n- **DisplayPort (DP)**: Very common on PCs and monitors. Often supports higher refresh rates and resolutions than HDMI at a given time. Can be adapted to HDMI.\n- **USB-C**: The most versatile connector. A single USB-C cable can carry video (using DisplayPort Alternate Mode), data, network, and power to charge a laptop. This "one cable solution" is a key feature in modern meeting rooms.',

        title: 'The EDID Handshake',
        content:
          '**EDID (Extended Display Identification Data)** is a crucial piece of information that makes "plug and play" possible. It is the data a display sends to a source device to tell it what its capabilities are.\n\nWhen you plug in an HDMI cable, an **"EDID handshake"** occurs:\n1. The display says, "Hi, I\'m a 1080p TV and I support stereo audio."\n2. The source device reads this and says, "Okay, I will send you a 1080p signal with stereo audio."\n\nIf this handshake fails (due to a bad cable or incompatible device), you will often get a **black screen or "No Signal"** message, even if everything is plugged in correctly.',

        title: 'Understanding Bandwidth',
        content:
          '**Bandwidth** is the data rate of a signal, measured in gigabits per second (Gbps). Higher resolution, higher frame rates, and less compression all require more bandwidth.\n\n- **1080p @ 60Hz** requires about 4.46 Gbps.\n- **4K @ 60Hz 4:4:4** requires **17.82 Gbps**.\n\nThis is why **18Gbps** is a critical number. All devices in a 4K60 signal chain (cables, switchers, extenders) must be rated to handle at least 18Gbps of bandwidth, or the signal will fail.',

      title: 'Chroma Subsampling',
      content:
        "To save bandwidth, video signals often use chroma subsampling. It's expressed as a ratio like **4:4:4**, **4:2:2**, or **4:2:0**.\n\n- **4:4:4**: **No compression**. Every pixel gets full color information. This is **crucial** for sharp text and computer graphics.\n- **4:2:0**: **High compression**. Color information is shared across a 2x2 block of pixels. It\'s acceptable for movies and broadcast TV but can make text look blurry.\n\nFor most corporate and education applications, **4:4:4** support is preferred to ensure computer-generated content looks crisp.",

Common rates are 24fps (cinema), 30fps, and 60fps.\n- **Refresh Rate (Hz)**: How many times per second the **display** redraws the image on the screen. Common rates are 60Hz, 120Hz, and higher for gaming.\n\nFor a smooth image, the display\'s refresh rate must be equal to or higher than the source\'s frame rate.',

A failure results in a black screen or an error message.\n- **HDCP 2.2** or higher is required for most **4K** content from streaming services and UHD Blu-ray.',
