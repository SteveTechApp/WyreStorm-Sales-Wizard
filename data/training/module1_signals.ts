        '- **SD (Standard Definition):** 720x480 (NTSC) or 720x576 (PAL). Largely obsolete.',
        '- **HD (High Definition) / 720p:** 1280x720 pixels.',
        '- **FHD (Full High Definition) / 1080p:** 1920x1080 pixels. Still a very common standard for broadcast and basic conferencing.',
        '- **QHD (Quad High Definition) / 1440p:** 2560x1440 pixels. Common for computer monitors.',
        '- **UHD (Ultra High Definition) / 4K:** 3840x2160 pixels. The modern standard for high-quality displays and content. It has four times the pixels of 1080p.',

        '# What is Chroma Subsampling?',
        '',
        'Chroma subsampling is a type of compression that reduces the color information in a signal in favor of luminance data. The human eye is less sensitive to changes in color than to changes in brightness, so this is a clever way to save bandwidth without a significant perceptible loss in quality for motion video.',
        '',
        "It's expressed as a three-part ratio, such as **4:4:4**, **4:2:2**, or **4:2:0**.",
        '',
        '### The Ratios',
        '- **4:4:4:** No compression. Every pixel has unique color and brightness information. This is crucial for computer-generated text and graphics to appear sharp and clear.',
        '- **4:2:2:** Half horizontal chroma resolution. The color information is sampled from pairs of pixels.',
        '- **4:2:0:** Quarter chroma resolution. Color information is sampled from a 2x2 block of pixels. This is the most common for streaming services and Blu-ray, as it offers the best bandwidth savings.',
        '',
        "**Why it Matters:** While 4:2:0 is fine for movies, it can make text and fine lines (like in a spreadsheet) look blurry or have color artifacts. For presentation systems, **4:4:4 is always preferred** to ensure maximum clarity."

        '',
        '### How it Works',
        '1.  **Handshake:** When you connect an HDCP-compliant source (like a Blu-ray player) to an HDCP-compliant display, they perform a "handshake".',
        '2.  **Authentication:** The source asks the display, "Are you a licensed device allowed to receive my content?"',
        '3.  **Key Exchange:** If the display provides a valid key, the source encrypts the content and sends it. The display then decrypts it for viewing.',
        '',
        '### Versions and Compatibility',
        '- **HDCP 1.4:** Designed for 1080p content.',
        '- **HDCP 2.2 / 2.3:** Required for 4K UHD content from sources like 4K Blu-ray players, streaming services (Netflix, Disney+), and modern game consoles.',
        '',
        "**The Golden Rule:** Every single device in the signal chain (source, switcher, extender, display) MUST support the same or a newer version of HDCP. If even one device is not compliant, you will get a black screen or an HDCP error message. This is one of the most common troubleshooting issues in AV."

      options: ["720p", "1440p", "4K UHD", "DCI 4K"],
      correctAnswer: "4K UHD",
      explanation: "4K UHD (3840x2160) is the modern standard for high-quality displays and has four times the pixels of 1080p, providing a much sharper image for detailed content."

      question: "A client complains that text from their PC looks 'fuzzy' on their meeting room display. What technical specification is likely the cause and should be specified as 4:4:4 in your solution?",
      options: ["Resolution", "Chroma Subsampling", "HDCP", "Frame Rate"],
      correctAnswer: "Chroma Subsampling",
      explanation: "Chroma subsampling like 4:2:0 saves bandwidth but can make computer-generated text look blurry. Specifying a system that supports 4:4:4 chroma ensures maximum text clarity."

      correctAnswer: "HDCP 2.2",

      question: "If a client calls you saying their new 4K system is just showing a black screen when they play a movie, what is the most common copy protection issue you should ask them about first?",
      options: ["The cables are too long", "The resolution is set too high", "There might be an HDCP handshake issue between their devices", "The TV is on the wrong input"],
      correctAnswer: "There might be an HDCP handshake issue between their devices",
      explanation: "An HDCP handshake failure is the most common reason for a black screen when playing protected content. It means one device in the chain is not compliant, so the source refuses to send the video."
