        'A **LAN (Local Area Network)** is the collection of connected devices within a single physical location, like an office building. For AVoIP systems, the **network switch** is the heart of the system, acting as the virtual matrix switcher. Not all switches are suitable for AV.\n\nYou need a **Managed Switch** that can be configured to handle the high-bandwidth, real-time nature of video traffic.',

        'Every device on a network needs a unique **IP Address** to communicate, just like every house needs a unique street address.\n\n- **Static IP**: You manually assign a permanent IP address to each device. This is reliable but can be time-consuming to manage.\n- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**: A service on the network (usually on the router) that **automatically assigns** IP addresses to devices when they connect. This is much easier to manage, especially for large systems. Most AVoIP systems can work with either method.',

      content:
        'Key features to look for in a network switch for AVoIP include:\n\n- **PoE (Power over Ethernet)**: Can power encoders and decoders directly from the switch, simplifying wiring. Look for **PoE+ (802.3at)** for most devices.\n- **IGMP Snooping**: This is **crucial** for multicast traffic. It prevents video streams from flooding the entire network by only sending them to the ports that have requested them.\n- **Jumbo Frames**: Allows for larger packet sizes (e.g., 9000 bytes), which can improve efficiency when transmitting large amounts of video data.',

      title: 'Dedicated vs. Converged Networks',
      content:
        "There are two main approaches to deploying an AVoIP network:\n\n- **Dedicated Network**: The AV system runs on its own **physically separate network**, with its own switches. This is the simplest and most reliable method, as it isolates AV traffic from corporate data.\n- **Converged Network**: The AV system **shares the same network infrastructure** as the client's existing data, voice, and other services. This requires careful coordination with the IT department and advanced network configuration (like VLANs) to ensure performance.",

      question: 'What is the most critical feature a network switch must have for multicast AVoIP systems?',
      options: ['PoE', 'Jumbo Frames', 'IGMP Snooping'],
      correctAnswer: 'IGMP Snooping',
      explanation: 'IGMP Snooping is essential to prevent multicast video from overwhelming the network by only sending streams to the ports that need them.',

        'LAN',
        'DHCP',
        'IGMP',
      ],
      correctAnswer: 'DHCP',
      explanation: 'DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) simplifies network administration by leasing IP addresses to devices automatically.',
    },
    { question: "What does 'LAN' stand for?", options: ["Long Area Network", "Local Access Node", "Local Area Network"], correctAnswer: "Local Area Network", explanation: "A LAN is the network contained within a single physical location, like an office." },
    { question: "What is the primary benefit of using PoE?", options: ["It increases network speed", "It provides power to devices over the network cable", "It makes the network more secure"], correctAnswer: "It provides power to devices over the network cable", explanation: "Power over Ethernet simplifies wiring by eliminating the need for a separate power supply for devices like AVoIP decoders." },
    { question: "In a 'Converged Network', the AV system...", options: ["Has its own separate switches", "Shares the same switches with the client's data network", "Does not use a network"], correctAnswer: "Shares the same switches with the client's data network", explanation: "A converged network uses a single infrastructure for both AV and data, which requires careful configuration like VLANs." },
    { question: "Why is a 'Managed' switch required for AVoIP?", options: ["It is cheaper than an unmanaged switch", "It can be configured for the demands of video traffic", "It does not require power"], correctAnswer: "It can be configured for the demands of video traffic", explanation: "Features like IGMP Snooping and QoS are only available on managed switches, and they are essential for reliable AVoIP." },
    { question: "An IP address like 192.168.1.100 is...", options: ["A unique address for a device on a network", "The physical address of the device", "A type of network cable"], correctAnswer: "A unique address for a device on a network", explanation: "The IP address allows devices to find and communicate with each other on a network." },
    { question: "What is the simplest and most reliable way to deploy an AVoIP network?", options: ["On a converged network with VLANs", "On a dedicated, physically separate network", "Over the public internet"], correctAnswer: "On a dedicated, physically separate network", explanation: "A dedicated network isolates AV traffic, preventing it from interfering with, or being affected by, other network traffic." },
    { question: "What does 'Jumbo Frames' help with?", options: ["Powering devices", "Improving efficiency for large data transfers like video", "Encrypting the signal"], correctAnswer: "Improving efficiency for large data transfers like video", explanation: "Allowing larger packet sizes can make the transmission of high-bandwidth video more efficient." },
