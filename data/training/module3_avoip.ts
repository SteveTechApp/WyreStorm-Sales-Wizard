        '**AVoIP** (Audio-Visual over Internet Protocol) is the technology for sending AV signals over a standard IP network (like an office LAN).\n\nInstead of a traditional matrix switcher, AVoIP uses a system of **Encoders** and **Decoders**.\n- An **Encoder** connects to a source (like a PC or camera) and converts its AV signal into network packets.\n- A **Decoder** connects to a display or speaker and converts the network packets back into an AV signal.\n\nA standard network switch handles the routing, making the system incredibly flexible and scalable.',

      title: 'Unicast vs. Multicast',
      content:
        'AVoIP uses two main methods for sending signals:\n\n- **Unicast**: A **one-to-one** connection. The encoder sends a single stream directly to the IP address of one decoder. This is efficient for simple connections but not for distribution.\n- **Multicast**: A **one-to-many** connection. The encoder sends a single stream to a special multicast IP address. Any decoder on the network can subscribe to this address to receive the stream. This is incredibly efficient for sending one source to many displays (like in digital signage or a sports bar). **IGMP Snooping** on the network switch is required to manage multicast traffic effectively.',

      title: 'Benefits of AVoIP',
      content:
        'AVoIP offers several key advantages over traditional AV distribution:\n\n- **Scalability**: You are not limited by a fixed number of inputs and outputs. You can add more encoders or decoders at any time.\n- **Distance**: The transmission distance is virtually unlimited, constrained only by the reach of the network itself.\n- **Flexibility**: Any source can be routed to any display, or even to multiple displays simultaneously (multicasting).\n- **Advanced Features**: AVoIP enables features like **video walls, multiview** (multiple sources on one screen), and integration with other network services.',

        "WyreStorm's AVoIP product line is called **NetworkHD**. It includes several series based on different compression technologies (codecs):\n\n- **100/120 Series (H.264/H.265)**: A **low-bandwidth** solution ideal for large-scale deployments where network capacity is a concern. Good for digital signage and non-critical viewing.\n- **500 Series (JPEG-XS)**: A **high-quality, low-latency** solution that is visually lossless. Excellent for corporate boardrooms and command centers where quality is paramount.\n- **600 Series (Uncompressed)**: A **zero-latency, pixel-perfect** solution for the most demanding applications like medical imaging or broadcast, requiring a 10GbE network.\n\nAll NetworkHD systems are managed by the **NHD-CTL-PRO**, the system controller that provides a web interface and API for routing and configuration.",

      question: 'Which transmission method is used to send a single source to multiple displays efficiently?',
      options: ['Unicast', 'Multicast', 'Broadcast'],
      correctAnswer: 'Multicast',
      explanation: 'Multicast allows an encoder to send a single stream that multiple decoders can subscribe to, saving network bandwidth.',

      question: 'Which NetworkHD series would you choose for a mission-critical command center where image quality and zero latency are the top priorities?',
      options: ['120 Series', '500 Series', '600 Series'],
      correctAnswer: '600 Series',
      explanation: 'The 600 Series sends uncompressed video over a 10GbE network, resulting in pixel-perfect quality and no transmission delay.',

    { question: "In an AVoIP system, what is the role of the network switch?", options: ["It powers all the devices", "It acts as the virtual matrix, routing signals", "It compresses the video"], correctAnswer: "It acts as the virtual matrix, routing signals", explanation: "The network switch is the core of an AVoIP system, handling the distribution of network packets from encoders to decoders." },

    { question: "What does an AVoIP 'Decoder' do?", options: ["Connects to a source device", "Converts an AV signal into network packets", "Converts network packets back into an AV signal"], correctAnswer: "Converts network packets back into an AV signal", explanation: "The decoder is located at the destination (e.g., a display) and reconstructs the AV signal from the network stream." },
