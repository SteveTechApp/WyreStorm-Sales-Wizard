It might not be a specific number, but a range or an understanding of the investment required.\n- **Authority**: Are you speaking with the person who has the power to make the final purchasing decision? If not, who is, and how can you get in touch with them?\n- **Need**: What is the core business problem the client is trying to solve? Understanding their pain points is key to proposing the right solution.\n- **Timeline**: When does the client need the solution to be implemented? This helps you prioritize opportunities and manage resources.',
