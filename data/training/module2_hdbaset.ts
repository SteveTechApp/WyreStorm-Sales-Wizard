      content:
        "**HDBaseT** is a global standard for transmitting video, audio, USB, control signals, and power over a single standard category cable (like Cat6).\n\nIt solves the primary problem of modern AV: **distance**. Standard HDMI cables become unreliable over 15 meters, but HDBaseT allows for robust long-distance transmission, making it a cornerstone of professional AV installations.",

      content:
        'HDBaseT is famous for its **5-Play** feature set, which describes the five types of signals it can carry simultaneously:\n\n1.  **Uncompressed Video & Audio**: Transmit high-definition video and audio without loss of quality.\n2.  **USB**: Extend USB 2.0 for devices like interactive displays, cameras, and keyboards/mice (KVM).\n3.  **Ethernet**: Pass through a 100Mbps Ethernet connection.\n4.  **Control**: Send control signals like IR (Infrared) and RS-232.\n5.  **Power**: Deliver power to the remote device using **PoH** (Power over HDBaseT), eliminating the need for a power supply at the display end.',

      content:
        "HDBaseT has evolved, with different versions offering different capabilities.\n\n- **HDBaseT 1.0/2.0**: These are the most common versions and are categorized by distance into **Class A** (up to 100m) and **Class B** (up to 70m for 1080p). They support up to 4K30 video.\n- **HDBaseT 3.0**: The latest generation. It supports **uncompressed 4K60 4:4:4** video up to **100m** over a single Cat6a cable, along with 1Gb Ethernet and USB 2.0.\n\n**Note**: Always use high-quality, solid-core Cat6a cable for the best performance, especially with HDBaseT 3.0.",

        "How does HDBaseT compare to other signal extension methods?\n\n- **vs. Long HDMI Cables**: HDBaseT is far more reliable over distances greater than 15m.\n- **vs. Fiber Optic**: Fiber can go much longer distances (kilometers) and is immune to electrical interference, but is typically more expensive and fragile.\n- **vs. AVoIP**: AVoIP runs over a standard network and is more scalable and flexible for routing (many-to-many), whereas HDBaseT is a point-to-point connection (one-to-one).",

Using the wrong cable is the #1 cause of HDBaseT failures.\n\n- **Use Solid Core Copper**: Never use Copper Clad Aluminum (CCA) or patch cables for infrastructure wiring.\n- **CAT6a is Recommended**: For all new installations, especially for HDBaseT 3.0, CAT6a is the recommended standard.\n- **Termination Matters**: Both ends of the cable must be terminated correctly, usually to the **T568B** standard. Poor termination is a major source of signal loss.",

      title: 'Power over HDBaseT (PoH)',

It allows a transmitter (TX) to send power up the category cable to the receiver (RX), or vice-versa.\n\nThis is a huge advantage as it means you don't need to install a power outlet behind the display. One end of the extender pair powers the other.\n\n**Important**: Always check the datasheet to see if the PoH is **two-way** (either unit can power the other) or **one-way** (only the TX can power the RX).",
