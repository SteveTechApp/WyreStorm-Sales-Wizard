        'When evaluating a product, look for these key specs:\n\n- **Video Resolution**: Find the maximum supported resolution, refresh rate, and chroma subsampling (e.g., "4K/60Hz 4:4:4").\n- **HDCP Version**: Ensure it matches the requirements of the content and other devices (e.g., "HDCP 2.2 compliant").\n- **Bandwidth**: For switchers and extenders, this is often listed in Gbps (e.g., "18Gbps").\n- **Inputs/Outputs**: Note the type and number of connections (e.g., "3x HDMI In, 1x HDBaseT Out").\n- **Audio Formats**: Check for support of formats like PCM, Dolby, or DTS, and features like audio de-embedding.\n- **Control Ports**: Look for RS-232, IR, or Ethernet ports for control.\n- **Power**: Check the power consumption (in Watts) and whether it supports PoE or PoH.',
