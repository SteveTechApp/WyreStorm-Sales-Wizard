      title: 'Common Network Acronyms',
      content: 'Understanding these terms is fundamental to working with modern AV systems, which are heavily reliant on networks.\n\n- **LAN (Local Area Network)**: The private network within a single building or campus, like an office or school network. It connects all the local computers, printers, and AV devices.\n- **CAT Cable (Category Cable)**: Standard network cabling used for Ethernet, HDBaseT, and AVoIP. "CAT" is followed by a number indicating its performance (e.g., CAT6, CAT6a). Higher numbers mean better performance.\n- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**: A service that runs on a network router or server. It automatically assigns IP addresses to devices when they connect to the network. This saves you from having to manually configure every device.',

      title: 'Common AV Acronyms',
      content: 'These acronyms describe key technologies and concepts in AV signal distribution.\n\n- **BYOD/BYOM (Bring Your Own Device/Meeting)**: A room system designed to let users connect their own laptop (the device) and use it to run a video conference call (the meeting) with the room\'s camera and microphone.\n- **HDCP (High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection)**: An encryption standard built into HDMI to prevent copying of protected content like movies.\n- **AVoIP (AV over IP)**: A technology for sending audio and video signals over a standard network switch. It uses encoders and decoders.\n- **EDID (Extended Display Identification Data)**: The information a display sends to a source to tell it what resolutions and audio formats it can accept. A failed "EDID handshake" is a common cause of "no signal" issues.',

      title: 'Hardware Terminology',
      content: 'Knowing the role of each piece of hardware is key to understanding a system.\n\n- **Source**: Where the signal begins (e.g., laptop, media player, camera).\n- **Destination / Sink**: Where the signal ends (e.g., display, projector, speaker).\n- **Switcher / Matrix**: A device that routes multiple sources to one or more destinations.\n- **Extender**: A pair of devices (Transmitter and Receiver) that sends an AV signal over a long distance, typically using HDBaseT.\n- **DSP (Digital Signal Processor)**: An audio device that processes sound. It can mix microphones, cancel echo (AEC), and tune the room\'s acoustics.',

      content: 'An **IP Address** is a unique identifier for a device on a network, like `192.168.1.100`. No two devices on the same LAN can have the same IP address.\n\nA **Subnet Mask** (e.g., `255.255.255.0`) tells devices which part of the IP address is the "network" part and which is the "host" part. This allows them to know if another device is on the same local network (and can be talked to directly) or on a different network (and needs to go through a router).',

      content: 'You will hear **HDBaseT** constantly in pro AV. It is a technology standard for transmitting video, audio, control, and power over a single category cable (like Cat6).\n\nThink of it as a supercharged, long-distance HDMI cable. It solves the problem of HDMI signals becoming unreliable over about 15 meters. It always works as a **Transmitter (TX)** and **Receiver (RX)** pair.',

      content: 'A **Codec** (Coder-Decoder) is an algorithm used to compress and decompress data, especially video. AVoIP systems use codecs to reduce the amount of network bandwidth a video stream requires.\n\n- **H.264/H.265**: Highly compressed. Uses low bandwidth, but adds more latency (delay) and can reduce image quality. Good for streaming over the internet or on congested networks. (e.g., NetworkHD 100/200 Series)\n- **JPEG-XS**: Lightly compressed. Visually lossless with very low latency. A great balance of quality and bandwidth for pro AV use over 1GbE networks. (e.g., NetworkHD 500 Series)',
