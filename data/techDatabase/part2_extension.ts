## Part 2: Signal Extension Technologies

### HDBaseT
A point-to-point technology for sending AV, USB, Control, and Power over a single category cable.

- **HDBaseT 2.0**: ~10.2 Gbps native bandwidth. Supports 4K30 up to 70m (Class A). Uses Visually Lossless Compression (VLC/DSC) for 4K60 signals. Requires Cat6a.
- **HDBaseT 3.0**: ~18 Gbps native bandwidth. Supports uncompressed 4K60 up to 100m. Upgrades USB to 5Gbps speeds. Requires Cat6a.
- **PoH (Power over HDBaseT)**: Allows one device to power the other.

### Fiber Optic Extenders
- **Benefits**: Extremely long distances (km), immune to EMI, high security.
- **Drawbacks**: More fragile and typically more expensive than category cable.
