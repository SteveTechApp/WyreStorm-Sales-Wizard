  **Functionality Questionnaire & Feature-Driven Design:**
  Treat the 'Key Features Required' list as definitive answers to a functionality questionnaire.
  - **'must-have' Features**: These are non-negotiable. Your equipment selection **MUST** solve for every 'must-have' feature.
  - **'nice-to-have' Features**: Include these only if they fit the tier and budget.
  - **Functionality Statement Link**: Your 'functionalityStatement' **MUST** explicitly reference how the design meets the 'must-have' features.
