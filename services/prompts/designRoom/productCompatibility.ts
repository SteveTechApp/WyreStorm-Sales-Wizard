  **Specific Product Compatibility Rules:**
  1.  **Apollo Dongles**: The 'APO-DG2' dongle (wireless casting with USB/BYOM) is **ONLY** compatible with presentation switchers whose SKU ends in '-W' (e.g., 'SW-640L-TX-W'). You MUST NOT pair 'APO-DG2' with 'APO-VX20' or 'APO-210-UC'. For simple wireless video/audio casting to those devices, the correct dongle is 'APO-DG1'.
